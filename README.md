</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[Non-secure empty app template](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce239531-non-secure-template)" application with the desired name "NonsecureEmptyAppTemplate" configured for the *KIT_PSC3M5_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSC3M5_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ce239531-non-secure-template --user-app-name NonsecureEmptyAppTemplate --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. The device must be provisioned with a policy containing the correct MPC configuration. To ease the provisioning process, two scripts are provided as part of the code example to provision the device with the required policy and to restore the device to its default configuration.

   Navigate to *`<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>`* directory and run the *provisioning.sh* script with modus-shell or Git Bash to provision the device with the policy provided in this code example.

   ```
   sh scripts/provisioning.sh
   ```

   To restore the device to its default configuration for executing other code examples or projects, run the *restore_provisioning.sh* script with ModusShell or Git Bash.
   ```
   sh scripts/restore_provisioning.sh
   ```

   If you need to provision the device step-by-step, follow these detailed instructions:

   1. Add policy and keys to the project.

      1. Ensure that you are in the *`<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>`* directory.

      2. Execute the following command to add policy and keys to the project:
         ```
         edgeprotecttools -t psoc_c3 init
         ```

         > **Note:** After executing of the `init` command, all files that are required for provisioning will be copied into the *`<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>`* directory, including the default policy for the chosen `<kit-name>`.

   2. Add the keys to be used for provision of device into the project.

      Generate keys using the following command:

      ```
      edgeprotecttools create-key --key-type ECDSA-P256 -o keys/oem_rot_priv_key_0.pem keys/oem_rot_pub_key_0.pem
      ```
      ```
      edgeprotecttools create-key --key-type ECDSA-P256 -o keys/oem_rot_priv_key_1.pem keys/oem_rot_pub_key_1.pem
      ```

   3. OEM provisioning.

      The default OEM policy configures the entire memory to be secure. To program and execute the non-secure application, modify the OEM policy. A modified OEM policy is supplied with this code example which configures some region of memory as non-secure. The OEM policy is available here *`<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>/ns_policy/policy_oem_provisioning.json`*.

      To provision the device with the new policy, execute the following command:
      ```
      edgeprotecttools -t psoc_c3 provision-device -p ns_policy/policy_oem_provisioning.json
      ```

      > **Note:** If the memory map of the code example is modified, then update the MPC configuration in the OEM policy with corresponding changes and provision the device again with the updated policy.


4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

    From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
    ```
    make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
    ```

    Example:
    ```
    make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
    ```
   </details>

4. Confirm that the kit LED blinks at a 1 Hz frequency.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

The design of this application is simple to help the user to get started with code examples on PSOC&trade; Control MCUs. This template PSOC&trade; C3 MCU application have a two-project structure to develop code for the CM33. The CM33 core has two separate projects for the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) and Non-secure Processing Environment (NSPE). A project folder consists of two subfolders – each denoting a specific aspect of the project. The two project folders are as follows:

**Table 1. Application projects**

Project | Description
--------|------------------------
proj_cm33_s | Project for CM33 Secure Processing Environment (SPE)
proj_cm33_ns | Project for CM33 Non-secure Processing Environment (NSPE)

In this code example, at device reset, the boot process starts from the ROM boot as the Root of Trust. From the ROM boot, the boot flow is passed on to the System CPU Subsystem where the secure CM33 application is first started. After all necessary secure configurations, the flow is passed on to the non-secure CM33 application. Resource initialization for this example is performed by this CM33 non-secure project. It configures the system clocks, pins, clock to peripheral connections, and other platform resources.
